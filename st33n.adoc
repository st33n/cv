== Who am I?

I'm a CTO and Software Specialist for the Danish branch of Jayway, which employs some of the best software developers in the industry.
We consult on all aspects of software development, and are owned 100% by the employees.

Since first discovering computers in the mid 1980s as a kid, I've been writing code in multiple platforms and languages. In the 90s
I studied both computer science and human-computer interaction, enabling me to design and build things that are elegant and simple,
inside and out.

I take a keen interest in agile/lean ways of working, how teams perform, information and interaction design, software architecture,
operations, and much more. Shortening the feedback loop, on all levels, evolving and molding systems until they solve the right
problems for the right people, and no more.

.Front-end Tool Chain
****
[[frontend-tools]]
React.js, Bootstrap, Backbone.js, d3.js, SVG, Raphaël, jQuery
****

My best work for Jayway includes building complex Javascript-based front-ends.
Also, responsible for technical interviews when we recruit sociable geeks.

I've been a speaker (and am part of the program committee) for http://www.oredev.org[Øredev], the largest developer conference in the
Copenhagen-Malmö area, most recently in 2013 on http://vimeo.com/79128729#t=28m30[making enterprise apps more fun and enjoyable], using UX conventions from touch interfaces and information
design.

.Programming Languages
****
[[programming_languages]]
JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Basic, Pascal, Modula 2, C, C++, Perl
****

First and foremost I am a geek at heart, enjoying creating useful software for people.

== Employments

=== CTO & Software Specialist
****
[[experience_jayway]]
*2006-present*: Jayway ApS
****

Since being employed in 2006 as the first Danish employee, I've done consulting on most areas of software development and architecture.
I do technical interviewing for potential hires, help arrange our conference Øredev, and try to keep up-to-date on contemporary technology.

Some of the clients I've worked for during my years at Jayway include:

* Sony Ericsson (Xperia Lounge Voucher Server - Java architect)
* http://www.truesec.se[TrueSec] (Java architect/developer)
* http://www.cloudfinder.com[Cloudfinder]
* 3 (https://www.3.dk/business/services/3omstilling/[3Switch])
* Politiken (Release Management, front-end development)
* Polfoto (front-end and back-end development)
* Ekstra Bladet (EKSTRA, eBladet - front+back-end development)
* WATCHME (EU Project, http://www.project-watchme.eu/)
* INMOTOS (EU Project through AmanziTel, see later)
* BoB / KPerson (internal tools for resource planning at Jayway)

=== Senior Software Consultant
****
[[experience_novell]]
*2002-6*: Novell Inc. +
*2001-2*: SilverStream Software +
*2000-1*: Wapportal (2000-1) +
****

Although I joined the small startup Wapportal in 2000, back when WAP was the next big thing for mobile, we soon found ourselves engulfed by
first SilverStream Software, and then a year later by Novell, where we ended up a sort of skunk works. We mostly built XML-based Eclipse
tooling products for Novell's line of identity management products. I ended up having implemented, among other things, the XML Schema
standard, for use in an innovative XML editor. Our Danish development office was finally shut down in late 2005.

=== Applications Consultant
****
[[experience_tibco]]
1997-2000: TIBCO Finance Technology, Inc.
****

My first job was with TIBCO, where I spent most of my time at Danske Bank HQ in Holmens Kanal, developing market data displays
for traders, and supporting their TIBCO message bus installation. It was an intense experience at times, where I learned to
think on my feet. I became friendly with the principles of real-time information display to support challenging
business requirements, and UNIX command-line tools. I helped manage servers spread over more than 20 sites,
performing upgrades and diagnosing networking issues.

For 4 months in 1999 I worked on-site on a project in Zürich for Credit Suisse First Boston, where I supported the back-end system
for youtrade.ch, an online equities trading platform for private customers in Switzerland. I was a key part of the TIBCO support team,
responsible for keeping the system running 24/7, and performing upgrades at pre-scheduled times in the night.

== Education

=== B.A.
****
[[education1]]
1991-1997: Computer/Information Science
****

I studied http://cs.au.dk/[Computer Science] at Århus University for 3 years before switching majors to
http://bachelor.au.dk/informationsvidenskab/[Information Science], a humanist approach
to computing. This has given me a solid background in core computer science, as well as an understanding of the human factors in
computing. I reached the point where I could start my Master's Thesis, but instead decided to start my first job.

== Selected experiences

This section highlights some of the more visual projects I've been a part of.

=== KPerson

Competence database for Jayway.

****
[[kperson-selected-exp]]
2008-2015 for Jayway. Based on Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap.
****
image:img/kperson.png[KPerson]

KPerson, an internal tool at Jayway, was built in 2008 by me and a couple of other consultants at Jayway
as a Rails 2 application, then maintained and upgraded by me over the next 7 years. It is now a Rails 4 application
based on the Bootstrap CSS library, making it responsive for phone and tablet use.

KPerson is a database of each consultant's background and skills. Consultants are required to update their
skills and experiences, and our sales people use the information to search for consultants suitable for incoming assignments,
then automatically generate and download PDF resumes in the correct format.

=== INMOTOS

Interdependency Modelling Tools and Simulation Based Risk Assessment of ICT Critical Infrastructures Contingency Plans

****
[[inmotos]]
2011-12 (6 months), for AmanziTel and the EU.
****
image:img/inmotos.png[INMOTOS CPN Simulation]

For the INMOTOS project, I was tasked with converting a large number of requirements and specifications into a working
prototype able to simulate complex infrastructure such as power plants and pipelines. I decided to use Coloured Petri-Nets,
a visual programming and modelling tool, creating http://github.com/st33n/cpn[an implementation in Ruby]footnoteref:[cpn,Open sourced in 2012].
The simulation front-end was a JavaScript application which used websockets to display a live view of the simulation
in-browser, complete with development tools. It used the Raphäel library to display SVG-based
graphicsfootnoteref:[cpndemo,Demonstration video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riLWVf_3BOQ].

== Conclusion

As is clearly apparent from the graph below, I have improved constantly since starting my professional career in 1997.
I am now able to tacke problems in a few days that would have taken me weeks fresh out of university. Due to my
extensive experience with different technologies, I can design user interfaces, evaluate and use new JavaScript frameworks
and libraries at roughly the rate at which they are produced, build server-side APIs and deploy them on cloud based
infrastructure, and much more.
