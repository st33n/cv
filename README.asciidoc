# My CV

This repo contains my ongoing research into fun ways of representing a resume online. It uses an Asciidoc source file
(st33n.adoc), which is transformed to HTML and meant to be used with the excellent Edward Tufte-like stylesheets
from https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css.

The result can be seen on http://st33n.github.io/cv.

Usage: Install 'grunt' and 'asciidoc' and run the grunt task. This will:

* Use asciidoc to transform the source files into a new version of 'index.html'. Do not modify index.html directly.
* Watch the source files for changes, and perform the previous step again.
